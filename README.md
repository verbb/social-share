Social Share is a toolkit for sharing and displaying social media information on your site. It can handle generating social media buttons, share dialogs and share counts.

## Features
- Support for 80+ social media providers.
- Fetch a count for the number of people following a social media account.
- Fetch a count for the number of times a URL has been shared on social media.
- Render social media icon buttons, including social share buttons.
- Theming options for buttons to save you precious development time. Highly customisable!
- Make use of bundled SVG icons and brand colours for socials. Stop lugging around icons and CSS from project-to-project.
